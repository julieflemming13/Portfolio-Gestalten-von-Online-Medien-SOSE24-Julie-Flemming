## Description of my Portfolio:
I created a Website using HTML and JavaScript. \
\
**Input**: This Website shows a canvas and multiple buttons where you can either enter a number, insert a word or choose a word. Based on your choices the Output changes. \
\
**Output**: On the canvas you will see a random amount of shapes, those shapes depend on the "feeling" you chose. \
        Also the background will change, if you enter your Name. That depends on the amount of letters your Name has.\
        The amount of shapes can also change if you insert a number that "rates your day". 
####    The placement and the amount of the shapes is always random.

The design of the Website is colorful and playful, as if its designed for Kids. ItÂ´s supposed to be fun for the users. \
\
*Aim of the created code/algorithm is, that you can create Art that expresses your feelings. If your feelings change, the Artwork changes.* ;)
